title: "What David Beazley Taught Me About Python (and Thinking)"
description: "A personal reflection on finishing Beazley’s advanced Python course — and how it changed the way I code and reason."

After completing all the exercises, projects, and puzzles from David Beazley’s course, I walked away with something far deeper than Python syntax.

This wasn’t just a course on programming.

It was a course on **thinking**.

---

## What I Expected

I thought I would review Python fundamentals, sharpen my syntax, and maybe pick up some tricks about coroutines.

What I got instead was a journey into:

- The nature of computation
- The beauty of protocol design
- The discipline of modular reasoning
- The dangers of magic and the power of clarity

## What I Learned

Here’s what stuck:

- **Generators** aren’t just lazy lists — they’re control structures
- **Coroutines** let you model interaction, not just calculation
- **Exceptions** are a form of communication — and must be designed as such
- **Context managers** bring lifecycle awareness to code
- **Async/await** is clearer when you’ve lived through `yield from`
- **Stacks, state machines, and protocols** are timeless ideas — and Python gives you the tools to build them with precision

---

## How It Changed Me

I now approach problems differently:

- I think in terms of pipelines and flows
- I isolate concerns before reaching for tools
- I understand when to reach for a class, a function, or a coroutine
- I debug less because I design better

Most importantly, I **enjoy the language more**. I see it as a space to explore ideas, not just ship solutions.

## Gratitude

To David Beazley — thank you.

Your clarity, humor, and craftsmanship turned a language course into a philosophy of engineering.
