The final project in David Beazley’s course was a **puzzle** — not just in content, but in form.

It required integrating everything we’d learned: generators, coroutines, context managers, exceptions, async/await, and modular design.

---

## Step 1 — Understanding the Puzzle

The file `puzzle.py` presented a nontrivial problem: implement a system where control flows through multiple layers of logic, and different mechanisms (like input validation, error recovery, and coroutine delegation) must cooperate seamlessly.

---

## Step 2 — Breaking It Into Components

I approached it by modularizing:

- A **controller** function to coordinate subcomponents
- **Coroutines** that model parts of the puzzle (e.g. state machines, filters)
- Exception handling for invalid transitions
- Optional `async def` blocks to simulate delays or I/O

This helped isolate each responsibility and made debugging easier.

---

## Step 3 — Coroutine Chains

One key part involved **delegation with `yield from`**, where one coroutine passed control to another — like a relay:

```python
def solver():
    result = yield from subsolver()
    yield result
```

This created a layered system where each part could report back or yield intermediate progress.

---

## Step 4 — Validation and Backtracking

The system included input validation and error-driven recovery:

```python
try:
    next_state = transition(current_state, input)
except InvalidMove:
    yield "Invalid"
    return
```

It mimicked **backtracking logic**, where failing paths could be discarded and retried.

---

## Step 5 — Reflections

This wasn’t just a puzzle — it was an exam.

It tested:

- Design under constraint
- Use of Python's control flow features
- The balance between readability and flexibility

---

## What I Learned

- Writing "clever" code is easy; writing **clear, correct, and extensible** code is harder — and more valuable
- Python’s coroutine model is powerful when used well, but requires discipline
- Breaking problems into composable pieces is key to solving complex tasks

This final project sealed the deal. I now see Python not just as a scripting tool, but as a **language of architecture, control, and elegance**.
