The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics awarded to John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton for their work on emergent phenomena inspired by the brain isn’t just a celebration of two brilliant scientists—it’s a landmark moment symbolizing how the boundaries of physics expand to embrace biology and computation. But how did we get here? As William Bialek explores in *Emergence of Brains* and *Biophysics: Searching for Principles*, the relationship between physics and biology runs deep.

## An Entwined History
Physics and biology have been inseparable since the dawn of modern science:

- **17th century**: Microscopes revealed microorganisms, blurring lines between matter and life.  
- **18th century**: Experiments on "animal electricity" (e.g., Galvani) laid foundations for modern electrodynamics.  
- **19th century**: Thermodynamics was only validated once it explained energy budgets in animal movement.  

Even 20th-century triumphs (DNA structure, genetic code) left a question unanswered: Is this merely *physics applied to biology*, or does a genuine *physics of life* exist—with the same stature as particle or condensed matter physics?

## The Physics Mindset
Bialek argues that physics seeks **simple, universal principles**, while biology celebrates life’s complexity and diversity.  
The genius of Hopfield’s kinetic proofreading, for example, lies in how it:

> "engaged with biological complexity to uncover simple, general issues with the unambiguous look and feel of physics problems."

Critically, Hopfield and Hinton did not *apply physics to biology*. Instead:

> "They asked new questions in physics’ intellectual tradition, motivated by phenomena traditionally studied by biologists."

## Physics as a Point of View
This is the crux: *"Physics is a point of view"* (Hopfield’s Nobel lecture title). This approach demands:

- **Rejecting disciplinary colonialism**: Collaborating with biology, not conquering it.  
- **Asking new questions**: Using biological phenomena to probe universal physical principles.  
- **Embracing complexity without losing essence**: Finding unity in life’s diversity.

As Bialek stresses:

> "Physicists must not be colonialists. We look to phenomena studied by others and ask new questions that pique our peculiar interests."

## Lessons for the Future
This interdisciplinary journey teaches us:

- **Patience is essential**: Insights can take a full generation to ripen (e.g., Hopfield networks → modern AI).  
- **Collaboration is non-negotiable**: Especially amid attacks on scientific inquiry.  
- **AI bridges new frontiers**: Systems like AlphaFold (2024 Chemistry Nobel) show how AI solves profound scientific problems, further expanding boundaries.

## Final Reflection

What does it mean to be a physicist in the 21st century?
Bialek’s answer: To seek universal principles in nature’s most intricate and unexpected corners—from the folding of a single protein to the emergence of thought itself.

The real challenge is not just solving problems in biology, but discovering principles through biology—principles that may redefine physics as we know it.

Next time you see a biological system, ask: **What universal physical principles might operate here?**  
The answer could transform not just your understanding of life—but of physics itself.
