# Social Distancing Simulator: See How Your Choices Change an Outbreak  

**Title:** *When Pixels Teach Prevention: Why This Simulator Goes Viral*  
**Description:** Ever wondered how staying apart actually saves lives? This interactive tool shows—in real time—why that empty seat on the bus matters more than you think.

We've all seen the graphs and heard the advice. But what if you could *watch* how skipping that crowded party changes an epidemic's path? That's where the **Social Distancing Simulator** clicks—it turns abstract stats into "oh, *that's* why" moments.  

## How It Works (No PhD Required)  

Picture this: colorful dots bounce around your screen like a hyperactive screensaver. Each represents a person:  
- ⚪ **Healthy**  
- 🔴 **Infected** (and contagious)  
- 🟡 **Recovered** (immune)  
- ⚫ **Deceased**  

The magic happens when you tweak these dials:  

- **🚶 Social Distancing (0-100%)**  
  Crank it up → dots slow down or freeze. At 100%? Ghost town mode—zero infections spread.  

- **☠️ Mortality Rate (%)**  
  Set to 1% for flu-like reality, or 10% for apocalyptic drama.  

- **⏳ Infection Duration**  
  Longer sickness = more spread opportunities.  

## Why It Sticks With You  

Unlike textbook equations, this simulator shows the *domino effect* of choices:  
- Watch "flatten the curve" happen when nudging distancing from 20% → 60%  
- See how *just a few rule-breakers* can reignite outbreaks  
- Observe immunity build (or collapse) like a visual novel  

## The Fine Print  

Creator Andrej Bauer is upfront: **"This isn't prophecy."** Real epidemics involve:  
- Hidden carriers  
- Mask effectiveness  
- Vaccine rollout  

*His disclaimer:* "It's a conversation starter, not a crystal ball."  

## Built by the Internet, For the Internet  

The project's open-source heart beats on **[GitHub](https://github.com/andrejbauer/social-distancing-simulator)** where:  
🌎 Volunteers translated it into 15+ languages  
👩‍🏫 Teachers use it in classrooms  
🧑‍💻 Redditors debate optimal settings  

*That's its superpower:* Making complex science feel communal.  

## Why This Matters Now  

With misinformation spreading faster than pathogens, tools like this cut through noise by letting you *test theories yourself*. When you see 70% distancing saves 80% of dots? Suddenly, those six feet make visceral sense.

> *Bottom line:* It's not about fear—it's about seeing how small actions create collective armor. And really, what's more human than that?
