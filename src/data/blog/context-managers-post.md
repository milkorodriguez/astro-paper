In this stage of the course, we dove into one of Python’s most elegant features: **context managers**.

Everyone has used `with open(filename)` — but few understand what really happens under the hood. This part of the course uncovered that mystery.

---

## Step 1 — What Is a Context Manager?

A context manager is any object that defines two special methods:

```python
def __enter__(self):
    # Setup logic (open file, acquire resource)
    return something

def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
    # Cleanup logic (close file, release resource)
```

This is what the `with` statement uses behind the scenes.

---

## Step 2 — Building One From Scratch

We built a context manager that times a code block:

```python
import time

class Timer:
    def __enter__(self):
        self.start = time.time()
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        self.end = time.time()
        print(f"Elapsed: {self.end - self.start:.2f} seconds")
```

Used like this:

```python
with Timer():
    # Some expensive operation
    result = sum(i * i for i in range(10**6))
```

---

## Step 3 — Handling Exceptions Gracefully

The `__exit__` method can control whether exceptions are suppressed:

```python
def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, traceback):
    if exc_type:
        print("An error occurred:", exc_val)
    return True  # Suppress exception
```

---

## Step 4 — Using contextlib

To avoid writing boilerplate classes, Python includes `contextlib`:

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def timer():
    start = time.time()
    yield
    end = time.time()
    print(f"Elapsed: {end - start:.2f} seconds")
```

Same behavior, less code.

## Lessons Learned

- Context managers are not just for files — they're for **any resource that needs setup and teardown**
- You can use them to **wrap logic** cleanly, especially when debugging, timing, or handling transactions
- Writing your own makes you appreciate how Python balances simplicity with power

Next up: we’ll explore **exception handling patterns** in depth — and how Python’s control flow and call stack really behave.
