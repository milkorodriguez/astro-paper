This post summarizes a project I developed with Franco Silva and Anthony Talavera during the Data Analytics Specialization program at PUCP (2024–2025). Our goal was to evaluate churn prediction models not just by technical metrics, but by their *economic impact* — specifically, the business value generated by different hypotheses.

## Key Highlights

- We implemented a churn prediction pipeline using `RandomForestClassifier` and optimized it through `RandomizedSearchCV` and `Permutation Importance`.
- The project featured a custom cost-benefit function tailored to a telecommunications context.
- We compared two hypotheses (H0 and H6) in terms of **net gain** and **total loss**.
- Our model achieved:
  - Precision: 97.8%
  - Reduction in total loss: **61.9%**
  - Gain improvement: **161.82%**

## Visual Insight

The following graph compares H0 and H6 based on projected revenue gains and prevented losses:

## Technical Stack

- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization
- Custom transformers using `BaseEstimator`, `TransformerMixin`

## Why Business Value?

Rather than optimizing purely for precision or F1-score, we asked:

> What model reduces losses *and* improves revenue most effectively?

By simulating costs of false positives and true positives, we calculated a business-oriented metric of success.
