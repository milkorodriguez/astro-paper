# Understanding `py-dispatcher`: A Simple Priority Queue in Python

This is an interesting small project: [`py-dispatcher`](https://github.com/Milko-R/py-dispatcher). It is a minimal implementation of a dispatcher queue system that handles tasks based on priority.

## What Is It?

At its core, the `py-dispatcher` project defines a class that allows enqueuing items and dispatching them based on their priority. It uses the `heapq` module under the hood to maintain a priority queue efficiently.

## Why Is It Useful?

This kind of dispatcher is useful in scenarios like:

- Managing job execution with different priority levels.
- Task scheduling systems.
- Simulation engines or event queues.
- Lightweight task management in microservices or bots.

## How Does It Work?

The core logic resides in a single Python file `dispatcher.py`, where a `Dispatcher` class manages a heap queue.

The key features include:

- Enqueueing tasks with a given priority.
- Dispatching (retrieving) tasks based on the highest priority.
- Ensuring performance using Python's built-in `heapq`.

## Final Thoughts

Although it's a small and straightforward project, `py-dispatcher` demonstrates how simple tools like `heapq` can be used to build efficient systems. It's perfect for learning and for lightweight use cases where you need to manage task priority.
