CSV files are everywhere â€” from open data portals to scraped exports, to datasets for training machine learning models. Theyâ€™re often the first format youâ€™ll encounter when working with real-world data.

This post is a hands-on, step-by-step guide on how to work with CSVs in Python using both built-in tools and the powerful `pandas` library.

## ðŸ”¹ What is a CSV File?

CSV stands for *Comma-Separated Values*. Each line represents a row, and each comma-separated item is a column.

```csv
name,age,city
Alice,30,New York
Bob,25,London
```

Sometimes, values are separated by tabs, semicolons, or spaces â€” the concept is the same: structured text.

## ðŸ”¹ Reading CSV Files without pandas

You donâ€™t need `pandas` to read a CSV file. Pythonâ€™s built-in `csv` module does the job:

```python
import csv

with open("data.csv") as f:
    rows = csv.reader(f)
    headers = next(rows)
    for row in rows:
        print(dict(zip(headers, row)))
```

You can also convert the column types:

```python
types = [str, int, str]
converted = [func(val) for func, val in zip(types, row)]
```

## ðŸ”¹ Converting Space-Separated Data to CSV

Sometimes the data looks like this:

```
John    1000    Lima
Maria   1500    Arequipa
Luis    1200    Trujillo
```

Hereâ€™s how to convert it to CSV format:

```python
import csv

with open("data.txt") as infile, open("data.csv", "w", newline="") as outfile:
    writer = csv.writer(outfile)
    for line in infile:
        row = line.strip().split()
        writer.writerow(row)
```

## ðŸ”¹ Downloading CSV Files from GitHub

To download a raw CSV hosted on GitHub:

```python
import urllib.request

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/main/data.csv"
urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, "data.csv")
```

This saves the file locally for later use.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Using pandas for Exploration

Once your CSV is ready, use `pandas` to load and explore it:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(df.head())
```

### Get Top N Rows

```python
def get_top_n_rows(df, n=5):
    return df.head(n)
```

Useful when checking the start of large files.

## ðŸ”¹ Case Study: The Titanic Dataset

You can load a well-known dataset like Titanic:

```python
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv")
```

Get basic insights:

```python
print(df.info())
print(df["Survived"].value_counts())
```

Extract a subset:

```python
df_subset = df[["Name", "Sex", "Age", "Survived"]]
print(df_subset.head(10))
```

## ðŸ§­ Final Thoughts

These are foundational operations that will serve you well in every data project. Whether youâ€™re doing machine learning or cleaning messy files, understanding how to read, convert, and explore CSV files is an essential skill.

Later, youâ€™ll discover more powerful tools â€” but it all starts here.
