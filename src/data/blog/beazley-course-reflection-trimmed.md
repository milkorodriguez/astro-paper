I recently completed a deep-dive Python course by David Beazley — a name well known in the world of Pythonistas and systems programmers. What started as a refresher quickly became a revelation. This post is a personal reflection on the key ideas, moments of friction, and “aha!” insights that stuck with me throughout the course.

## 1. Python Is Simpler Than It Looks — and Trickier Than It Seems

Beazley has a rare gift: he teaches Python by stripping away abstractions rather than piling them on. Early exercises (like reimplementing `add()` or building a `Frac` class) reminded me that many “magic” features in Python are just protocol-driven behavior under the hood.

Rewriting basic operations like `+`, `==`, and `repr()` from scratch made me appreciate how much power lies in Python's dunder methods. It also made the built-in `fractions.Fraction` feel like less of a black box.

## 2. Introspection Isn’t Just Debugging — It’s a Language Feature

From the start, we used tools like `type()`, `isinstance()`, and `operator.add` not just to understand values, but to _interrogate_ Python’s object model.

```python
import operator
print(operator.add(2, 3))       # 5
print(operator.add("Hi ", "AI"))  # 'Hi AI'
```

This mindset — of exploring rather than assuming — helped me see Python as a dynamic, introspective system where types are discoverable and behavior is inspectable.

## 3. Writing a Class ≠ Understanding a Class

Sure, I had written classes in Python before. But writing a working arithmetic type from scratch — including simplification with `gcd`, comparisons, and error handling — is a different story.

What struck me was how Python lets you *negotiate meaning* between objects through operator overloading. You define what it means for two things to be equal, or for one to be less than another. It’s a kind of semantics by construction.
