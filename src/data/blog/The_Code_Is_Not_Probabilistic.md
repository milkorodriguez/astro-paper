The rise of models like GPT, Claude, and Copilot has transformed how we write software. Today, much of our code is no longer written from scratch but **co-written with generative models** that assist, suggest, and complete entire fragments.  
Amid this shift, a common but mistaken idea has emerged: that AI-generated code is “probabilistic.”

Many developers distrust code produced by AI because they believe it is probabilistic. In my view, this stems from confusing **how the model predicts tokens** with the nature of the **resulting code**. One thing is the generation process, and another, very different, is the final product.

## How models generate code

Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT or Claude generate text **token by token**, choosing the next word based on a probability distribution.  
This variability has been empirically documented: even with identical initial conditions, outputs can differ in structure and content.  
That part of the process is indeed **stochastic**.

## The resulting code is deterministic

However, once the model produces code, probability disappears.  
The file that remains in your editor is no longer a prediction but a **deterministic and knowable structure**—you can read it, test it, and debug it.  
**It is not a black box. It is plain, open, legible text.**

The code may contain errors or inconsistencies, but its behavior is verifiable: **it either compiles or it doesn’t, it passes tests or it doesn’t.**  
In that sense, it ceases to belong to the domain of the probabilistic and enters that of **logical and verifiable reasoning.**

## Research confirms it

Several researchers have pointed out the need to distinguish between the **stochastic nature of the model** and the **deterministic character of the environment** in which it operates.  
Ensigno (2024) notes that models “operate probabilistically in domains that demand exact prediction,” and that the solution is to design **deterministic workflows that control and validate** model outputs.  

This principle also underpins proposals such as **Blueprint First, Model Second**, which advocate architectures where the main system logic remains deterministic, delegating only **flexible generative tasks** to the LLM.

## Your responsibility: read critically

A developer’s real responsibility is not to expect perfect accuracy from AI, but to **read its output critically.**  
As Miguel Grinberg (2024) reminds us, reviewing AI-generated code is an essential skill, not a waste of time: *“understanding it is part of the job.”*

Models do not come to prevent us from reading code, but to **force us to read better.**  
If you can’t process the repetitive or imperfect code an AI produces, the problem is not the model but a lack of **technical literacy.**

Because code, though born from a probabilistic process, **is not probabilistic in itself.**  
It is knowable.  
And once you understand it, it’s yours.
