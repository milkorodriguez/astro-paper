If you've read our [deep dive on how SRT-H performs actual surgeries](link-to-your-main-post-here), you’ve seen it cut, stitch, and decide—almost like a human surgeon.  
But have you ever wondered what the name means?

It’s not some catchy branding. **SRT-H** is a literal summary of the robot’s core technologies.

## SRT-H = Surgical Robot Transformer - Hierarchical

### 🔤 Let’s break it down:

- **S = Surgical**  
  Not a warehouse picker or a factory arm. This robot was born for the OR—sterile, high-stakes, and human-focused.

- **R = Robot**  
  The physical agent. With arms, tools, and actuators that carry out procedures on real biological tissue.

- **T = Transformer**  
  This is the AI core. The same Transformer architecture behind ChatGPT is used here to:  
  → Understand natural language commands  
  → Plan surgical steps  
  → Reason through anatomical complexity  

- **H = Hierarchical**  
  The "H" is where the real magic happens. This refers to its **multi-level control structure**, where:
  ```plaintext
  Level 1: “Clip the cystic duct” (surgeon’s command)  
     ↓  
  Level 2: “Move arm 5cm right” (decomposed task)  
     ↓  
  Level 3: Motor control signals (execution)
  ```

This hierarchy allows the system to **abstract**, **reason**, and **act**—safely and effectively.

## 📌 Why it matters

So next time you read “SRT-H,” don’t skim past it.  
It’s not just an acronym—it’s a **compressed mission statement**, a summary of how cutting-edge AI, robotics, and control theory come together in the OR.
