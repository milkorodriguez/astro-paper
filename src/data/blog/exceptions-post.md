This project focused on a crucial part of writing resilient software: **handling errors and controlling program flow when things go wrong**.

In Python, this means mastering `try`, `except`, and custom exception classes — not just to catch bugs, but to design meaningful *failure behavior*.

---

## Step 1 — Custom Exception Classes

We started by defining custom exceptions that better describe what went wrong:

```python
class MessageError(Exception):
    pass

class EncryptionError(MessageError):
    pass

class FormatError(MessageError):
    pass
```

This builds a **hierarchy** of exception types, so you can catch general or specific errors depending on your needs.

---

## Step 2 — Raising Exceptions with Meaning

Instead of vague `ValueError` or `RuntimeError`, we raise domain-specific errors:

```python
def encode_message(msg):
    if not isinstance(msg, str):
        raise FormatError("Message must be a string")
    # continue encoding...
```

These make tracebacks easier to interpret and log files more useful.

---

## Step 3 — Handling Failures Gracefully

We then use `try/except` blocks to catch specific issues and take appropriate action:

```python
try:
    result = encode_message(data)
except FormatError as e:
    print("Formatting problem:", e)
except EncryptionError as e:
    print("Encryption failed:", e)
```

This avoids crashing the program on expected failure conditions.

---

## Step 4 — Designing Message Systems

The code in `message.py` simulates a messaging system where you might:

- Encode/decode messages
- Validate input
- Raise appropriate exceptions if anything goes wrong

This forced us to think about **how to communicate errors clearly**, both to users and developers.

---

## Takeaways

- Exceptions aren't just for bugs — they're for **expected failure modes**
- Custom exception classes improve clarity and structure
- Good error messages are as important as good code

Next, we’ll explore how exceptions interact with **stack traces**, and how Python's call stack behaves during normal and exceptional control flow.
