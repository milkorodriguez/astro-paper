Recently, I came across a real case that illustrates—almost ironically—the limits of artificial intelligence in everyday business.  

A company decided to automate part of its accounting workflow using an AI model based on ChatGPT to **process invoices in several of its branches**. At first, everything looked promising: the system handled documents quickly, employees celebrated how manual work was reduced, and the experiment seemed like a success.  

But soon problems started to emerge: invoices with **incorrect addresses**, misinterpreted fields, duplicated entries. What initially seemed like a breakthrough ended up causing **more than $10,000 in losses**.  

Meanwhile, in another part of the world, thousands of complex surgeries continue to be performed with the **Da Vinci robotic system**, renowned for its **millimetric precision and high success rates**.  

So here’s the paradox:  
**Why does AI stumble over something as “simple” as an invoice, yet can assist in something as delicate as surgery?**

## The paradox of “simple” vs. “complex”

The answer lies in the difference between **closed, consistent environments** and **open, chaotic ones**.  

### In the operating room: a closed, controlled world
- The Da Vinci system **is not autonomous**: a skilled surgeon is in charge of every movement.  
- The workspace is **limited and well-defined**: a specific organ or anatomical area.  
- Strict **medical protocols** standardize preparation, instrumentation, and procedure.  
- Variability exists (every human body is different), but it falls within **well-studied margins**.  
- The robot provides **clear 3D visualization**, and the surgeon constantly labels and interprets what is happening.  

👉 In short: the operating room is a **closed, predictable environment**, and that’s why robotic assistance can be so reliable.  

### In the accounting office: an open, messy world
- Every invoice looks different: formats, abbreviations, stamps, even handwritten notes.  
- There is no universal standard: “Address” in one document might be “Location” in another.  
- Human errors, poor scans, and inconsistent data are everywhere.  
- AI thrives on **consistent, repetitive patterns**, but here it faces **noise and heterogeneity**.  

👉 That’s why errors pile up: the AI isn’t “understanding,” it’s **guessing statistical patterns**.

## AI is statistics, not thought

Mathematician **Terence Tao** puts it bluntly: **AI doesn’t think—it’s statistics**. It doesn’t “understand” what it does. Instead, it adjusts millions (or billions) of parameters to predict the most probable output.  

- In robotic surgery, the closed, predictable world gives it an advantage.  
- In invoicing, the open, chaotic world overwhelms its statistical guesswork.  

Ironically, what looks harder (operating on a human body) is actually **more constrained** than what looks easier (processing invoices).

## The lesson for businesses

The takeaway is clear:  
- It’s not enough to have a powerful AI model—you must **choose the right context**.  
- AI shines in **well-defined environments with standardized data**.  
- It fails when asked to navigate **ambiguity and inconsistency**.  

If we want AI to handle invoices with the same reliability as robotic surgery, we first need to **redesign the system around it**: business rules, human validation, standardized data pipelines.

## Final reflection  

Perhaps the real question isn’t *“What can AI do for me?”* but *“What conditions must I create for AI to actually work well?”*  

The difference between a **$10,000 accounting loss** and a **successful life-saving surgery** is not in the “intelligence” of the machine, but in the **degree of order, control, and consistency of the environment where it operates**.
