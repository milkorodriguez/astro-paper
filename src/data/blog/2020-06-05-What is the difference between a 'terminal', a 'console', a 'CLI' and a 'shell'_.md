Adrienne Braganza defines the differences between them as follows:

### What is a Terminal?

At it's core, any input/output device. Our keyboards and mice are terminals. So are our ears and eyes. They are like terminals for sound.

### What is a console?

A physical terminal; a physical mechanism by which input can be collected. Thinking about it this way, it's easy to see how we share this word across industries: video game consoles in gaming, mixing consoles in music, and command consoles in aviation/space.

### What is a CLI?

CLI stands for  **C**ommand  **L**ine  **I**nterface. A CLI is a distinct type of interface that accepts input commands and then executes them once you hit the Return/Enter key.

### What is a shell?

A shell is a specialized command line interface; this is what actually recognizes the commands you enter and then tells the operating system to execute them. There are many flavors; cmd is the default shell on Windows, Bash is the default shell on most Linux distributions, and just recently, zsh became the default shell on macOS Catalina
