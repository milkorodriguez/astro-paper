AI image apps like **DALL·E** and **Stable Diffusion** are everywhere. They generate stunning visuals—but at what cost?

These models are trained on **millions of copyrighted artworks**, scraped from the internet **without consent or payment**. Artists’ styles are replicated, commodified, and sold—while the original creators are left behind.

Legally, it's a gray area. Companies defend the practice as "statistical learning", but it amounts to **mass creative appropriation**. Worse, artists can’t easily prove their work is being used, nor afford legal battles.

Ironically, **only corporate giants like Disney** may have the power to push back—if their IP appears in AI-generated outputs.

Without action, we risk a future of:
1. Homogenized art
2. Legal loopholes for tech giants
3. Vanishing careers in creative fields

This isn’t anti-tech. It’s **pro-artist**. Let’s build AI that uplifts creators—not replaces or exploits them.
