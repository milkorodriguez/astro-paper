Hi, I’m **Milko Rodríguez** — a philosopher turned data scientist, currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at **PUCP** (Lima, Peru). My background in philosophy shapes how I think about technology, ethics, and scientific knowledge.

This blog is my digital lab notebook.

## What I write about

- Machine Learning and AI for the life sciences  
- Bioinformatics tools and datasets (like UniProt, AlphaFold, ColabFold)  
- MLOps: pipelines, reproducibility, model deployment  
- The epistemology of scientific models — logic, probability, and learning  
- My transition from humanities to computing  

## Goals

I’m building the skills to contribute to AI for science, particularly in biology and health. I believe machine learning isn’t just a tool for business — it’s a way to better understand life itself.
